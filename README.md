# Mini-Quadruped-Robot ðŸ¤–

This is my Arduino-powered **Mini Quadruped Robot** â€” a simple four-legged walking robot inspired by the Instructables project [here](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Powered-Micro-Quadruped/). It uses 8 servo motors and an Arduino to simulate a basic walking motion.

## ðŸ”§ What It Does

- Walks using 4 legs (2 servos per leg)
- Controlled by Arduino Nano or Uno
- Lightweight and compact design
- Powered by USB or battery
